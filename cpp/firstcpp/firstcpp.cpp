#include <iostream>

using namespace std; //means that we can use names for objects and variables from the standard library.

int main() {
    cout << "Hello world\n";// for printing (cout"see-out" <<) the text
    cout << "How are you?" << "\n";// you can write "\n" also like this to be more readable
    cout << "New line" << endl; // this is also for new line

    cout << 5+5*2;

    //c++ is case sensitive cout and Cout has different meanings
    return 0;// ends the function
}
